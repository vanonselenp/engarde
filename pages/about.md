# The background to En Garde and it's founder, David Wagenfeld

His involvement in coaching in South Africa goes back to assisting at Bishops in the late 80's. Thereafter, he was instrumental in establishing a fencing club at Rondebosch Boys High in the early 90's, from which he moved to Fish Hoek Senior High School in 1994. At about this time, his night manager position in a hotel, enabled him to spend his daytime hours coaching either at a school, or doing development work in the New Crossroads township.

Almost 3 years was then spent in the Netherlands. Here, whilst continuing being an ordinary fencer at a Salle, he was "apprenticed" by a fencing master in Amsterdam. Two years were spent learning how to make fencing work in schools, and a model was developed how to apply it in South Africa. The name of that fencing school, from which so much was learnt, was "En Garde".

On arrival back in South Africa, a club was established in Fish Hoek, and for a year he continued with a full-time job. At the beginning of 1999, he took the plunge and decided to follow his passion for the sport. En Garde was born, and initially it was based at Fish Hoek, and looked at really establishing a foothold in this area. This has expanded over the years to include four junior schools, Bishops college, a training club and an adult evening group.

A number of our fencers have represented South Africa since 2003, most notably at the Junior World Champs - Jay New, Ian Goldsmid, Scott Chapman, Michael Malahe, Andrew Payne, Matthew Snelling, Damian Gordon, Robert Allen, James Atkins, Michael Erasmus, Ashleigh Long, Ashleigh Arton, Landon McClure and in 2011 - Robert McGregor. In 2010, Michael Erasmus and Michael Malahe went further, representing SA at senior level in Foil and Epee respectively!

## En Garde: facts and philosophies

* We are the biggest fencing school in the country with consistently over 100 students since 2003!

* En Garde students are among the top juniors in men’s foil and epee; and in senior men’s foil, we currently have three of the top eight, with two more being “alumni”!

* The top juniors in foil and epee have come from En Garde.

* In all, we hold 16 practices each week, operating within 7 clubs. Our best competitive fencers are invited to attend additional training on Saturdays within our Squad system. Once they have proven themsleves, they are then selected to the team which represents En Garde at provincial and national tournaments.

* Training is based on group lessons, with squad members receiving individual lessons if requested.

* Fun, and a strong team spirit are fundamental! We tend to be "followers of the way of the sword" first, and sportsmen or women second. Following a balanced approach is more important for an individual's development, than a "win at all costs" attitude.

* Social events form an integral part of our program.

* Other aspects of fencing are also explored, such as theatrical and historical fencing.

* "Traditional" values in the sense of what fencing is about, is very important to us, so we have a code of conduct as guide for students. Fencing is also a martial art, so integrity, respect and self-discipline are paramount.

* We follow a strategic plan that embraces what our students want, as well as following a vision of the "big picture".

* We organise a comprehensive system of individual and team competitions, for different levels and age-groups.

* A goal-orientation is crucial, so we use a ranking system as a way to measure absolute and relative progress in competitions. This is recognised by the awarding of "qualification certificates" and colours.

* Competitions are not the be-all-and-end-all of our activities, and proficiency in demonstrating the material is also evaluated and rewarded through grading and proficiency awards. 

## The En Garde “way” in brief


* The African philosophy of “Ubuntu” is intrinsic to the way we do things: we believe that we are who we are through others! It is the “process for earning respect by first giving it, and to gain empowerment by empowering others. It encourages people to applaud rather than resent those who succeed.” We are who we are we because we are part of something. This provides the context to build strong individuals who grow within a team.
