Modern fencing has many benefits and advantages as compared to other sports, here are some of the health benefits 

## A Cardio Vascular Workout:
Because fencing is based on combat, it is a fast-paced series of movements. The adrenalin and the rapid actions get your heart pumping and oxygen flowing. Regular cardio has been found to help with a) lowering cholesterol, b) increasing stamina, c) strengthening the heart and lungs, d) reducing the risk of heart disease, e) diminishing stress levels.

## A Calorie Burning Sport:
Fencing is practiced while wearing layers of protective gear, including pants, underarm protector, jacket, metallic vest (in Foil and Sabre), gloves and a mask. All this clothing and gear makes the body sweat more during intense combat and burns calories at a rapid rate, helping participants to lose weight and maintain a healthy weight. It also helps tone the body which leads to increased self-esteem.

## A Muscle Developer:
The offensive and defensive actions in fencing require precise body stances and subtle yet powerful arm and leg positioning. Repeating these actions lead to better hand-eye coordination, stronger muscles and increased flexibility. Success in fencing also requires participants to have good posture.

## A Mind Game:
Fencing is often compared to chess because opponents have to think several moves in advance and react logically to an action. However, it is more challenging than chess because it also includes intense physical activity. Fencing is an intense workout for the mind involving fast logic, a calm mind in a fast-paced and high-pressure environment.

## A Social Activity:
Fencing increases your confidence and builds relationships with other like-minded people who enjoy strategy, logic and physical prowess. Through fencing, the pressure of competitions tends to bring participants together and people develop a sense of self-worth and community.
