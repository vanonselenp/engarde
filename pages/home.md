# The Fencing school

The school was founded in Cape Town in 1999 by David Wagenfeld.

Within our structured approach, students learn the basic offensive and
defensive techniques of this noble art. Insight, speed, reactions and daring
are especially addressed in a course which gives attention to building the
studentsâ€™ ability to concentrate and control their aggression. Although the
object of the game is to hit without being hit, fencing is not a violent sport:
the philosophy is one of "harmonious conflict". Mutual respect is at the core
of the fencing ethos.

The age of chivalry lives on!

## How to begin fencing with us?

We cater for all ages - from 6 to 60! Anyone with a zest for life and a desire
to learn more about the art of fencing and themselves is welcome to join us for
a "trial period"!
